-- Use this for order id generation in payment gateway js code:
    //
      "OID".concat(Math.floor(Math.random() * 500)+100).concat("END")
    //
    This will generate a random order id with "OID" in the beginning + a random number between 100 & 500 + "END" at the end

-- replace order_id field with data_id in the js code for payment gateway [DEPRECIATED]
-- generate API key from razorpay dashboard settings menu[DEPRECIATED]
-- add the generated api key to the "key:" field in the payment gateway js file[DEPRECIATED]

----------------------------------------------------- **Things to add** --------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Find a way to check if pwa is installed or not and inform the user of the install status when opened in browser. [PENDING]
  |__implementnig this feature is not possible as of now as the browser only creates the "appinstalled" event once after the PWA has been installed.
  |__for successive app launches the browser does not create any more "beforeInstall" prompt and thereby no "appinstalled" prompt either.
