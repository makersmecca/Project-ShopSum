The interface of the app is essentially based around a Calculator, to calculate the total cost of all the items in an order and receive payments through a single-use QR Code, generated specifically for the current transaction amount, scannable via any UPI App.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike third-party payment gateway service providers, ShopSum requires no KYC Verification or bank details. Just sign-up and add your UPI ID to which you wish to receive your payments.<br/> 
The UPI ID gets linked to your sign-in method and just like that you’re good to go. It’s free, it’s fast and the entire process is streamlined.<br/>
<br/>

    <li>Easy Log-In: Sign up using your Email ID, Google OAuth, or Phone Number seamlessly.</li>
