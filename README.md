<h2>SHOP SUM</h2>
ShopSum is live! <a href = "https://letsshopsum.netlify.app">Check out ShopSum</a>.<br/>
ShopSum, a Progressive Web App designed for Roadside Stalls, Small Vendors, and even our humble Corner/Kirana Stores.<br/>
<br>
The interface of the app is essentially based around a Calculator, to calculate the total cost of all the items in an order and receive payments through a single use QR Code, generated specifically for the current transaction amount, scannable via any UPI App.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike third-party payment gateway service providers, ShopSum requires no KYC Verification, or bank details. Just Sign-up for free, add your UPI id to which you wish to receive your payments.<br/> 
The UPI id gets linked to your sign in method and just like that you’re good to go. It’s free, it’s fast and the entire process is streamlined.<br/>
<br/>
